# Steam Game Transfer Utility
Can copy steam games from library to library (usually over Windows/Samba shares)
This was only made to make it easy for people at a LAN party to copy already downloaded games 
from one another. We then don't have to wait as long to play games!

I probably won't add any fancy features in the future but felt like open sourcing it anyway.

Made for Windows, but would work for other platforms if the "look for exe" parts were expanded.

# Package into Installers
